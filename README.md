# Introduction
Greetings fellow students and welcome to Machines Instructed in Learning Chemistry IT or MILC IT!

With the increasing interest in applying machine learning at the Department of Chemistry, we thought it would be a great idea to make a Teams channel. We believe that there is a huge advantage of connecting people who do data analysis on all levels. One advantage of data analysis is that you are not constrained by your specific research field but your data. This allows us to work together across many research fields with different domain experts and bring new ideas to the table.

The core idea is that we look beyond our own research areas and focus on how we learn from data by applying data analysis methods. We want to be able to share experience, cool tricks, maybe even scripts to get people started and expand knowledge. Hopefully, this will ultimately help all of us to become better at our work and enhance the gain and quality.

- LET'S MILC IT ! 🐄🥛


# Hackathon
Data analysis is best learned by trying it out and this of course means a Hackathon. If enough people are interested in learning/applying some type of method, we could schedule a day or a couple of hours where we play around with it.
